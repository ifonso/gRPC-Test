# gRPC Test

A simple gRPC test project with server and client made with typescript.

If you want to change request/response types, you'll need to modify the `proto` file and recompile it. You'll need to have the `protoc` compiler installed.

## Running

Install dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

Run the server:

```bash
$ npm run server
```

Run the client:

```bash
$ npm run client
```
